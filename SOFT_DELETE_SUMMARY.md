# Soft Delete Implementation - Summary

## ✅ What Was Done

Your cold leads table now uses **soft deletes**. When you delete a lead, it's hidden from the UI but stays in the database to prevent n8n from re-adding it.

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ `deleted_at` column added to `cold_leads` table
- ✅ Partial index for fast active leads filtering
- ✅ Phone indexes for duplicate checking

**Run this SQL to add the indexes** (if not already done):
```bash
# Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
cat supabase-cold-leads-soft-delete.sql
```

### 2. Code Updates

#### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `src/lib/supabase-cold-leads.ts` - Added soft delete logic
2. ✅ `src/hooks/use-cold-leads.ts` - Filter out deleted leads
3. ✅ `src/app/crm/leads/cold-leads/page.tsx` - Bulk soft delete
4. ✅ `src/components/crm/lead-details-flexible.tsx` - Single soft delete

#### Key Changes:
- All fetch queries now include `.is('deleted_at', null)` to exclude deleted leads
- Delete functions now `UPDATE` with `deleted_at` timestamp instead of `DELETE`
- Cold leads use soft delete, engaged leads still use hard delete
- Better confirmation messages explaining the behavior

## 🚀 How It Works

### Before (Hard Delete)
```
User deletes lead → Lead removed from database → n8n can't check it → Duplicate gets added back 😤
```

### After (Soft Delete)
```
User deletes lead → deleted_at timestamp set → Hidden from UI → n8n sees it and skips → No duplicates! ✅
```

---

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### 1. Run the Index Migration (if not done)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
-- supabase-cold-leads-soft-delete.sql
```

### 2. Update Your n8n Workflow

**❌ OLD WAY (Wrong):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cold_leads 
WHERE phone = {{ $json.phone }}
AND deleted_at IS NULL  -- ❌ This will miss deleted leads!
```

**✅ NEW WAY (Correct):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cold_leads 
WHERE phone = {{ $json.phone }}
-- No filter on deleted_at - checks ALL leads including deleted
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Test:
1. Go to cold leads page
2. Delete a lead (it disappears)
3. Check Supabase - verify `deleted_at` is set
4. Run n8n with same lead → Should NOT create duplicate
5. New leads should still be added normally

### SQL Test Queries:
```sql
-- See all leads including deleted
SELECT company_name, phone, deleted_at 
FROM cold_leads 
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Count active vs deleted
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL) as active_leads,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL) as deleted_leads
FROM cold_leads;
```

## 📊 Frontend Behavior

### User Experience:
- Deleting a lead shows: *"Mark [Company] as disqualified? This will hide it from your list but keep it in the database to prevent duplicates."*
- Lead immediately disappears from list
- No "deleted" badge or indicator (clean UI)
- Can be restored via SQL if needed

### Bulk Delete:
- Select multiple leads → "Delete Selected"
- All get soft deleted at once
- Toast notification confirms deletion

---

## 🔄 Restoring Deleted Leads (Optional)

If you accidentally delete a lead:

```sql
-- Restore one lead
UPDATE cold_leads 
SET deleted_at = NULL 
WHERE id = 'lead-id-here';

-- Restore all recently deleted
UPDATE cold_leads 
SET deleted_at = NULL 
WHERE deleted_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
```

After restore, refresh the frontend and the lead reappears.

## 📈 Performance Impact

✅ **No negative impact!**
- Partial index makes active leads queries fast
- Phone indexes speed up duplicate checks
- Deleted leads don't slow down the UI

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "My workflow keeps adding duplicates"
→ Check your n8n query - make sure it's NOT filtering by `deleted_at IS NULL`

### "I want to permanently delete old leads"
→ Run cleanup script:
```sql
DELETE FROM cold_leads 
WHERE deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '6 months';
```

### "I need to see deleted leads"
→ Query Supabase directly:
```sql
SELECT * FROM cold_leads WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```
