# üöÄ Door2Door Deployment Guide

## **Simplified Git Workflow**

We've streamlined the deployment process to be **safe**, **clean**, **robust**, and **effective**.

### **Branch Structure**
- **`main`** - Production branch (live app)
- **`dev`** - Development/staging branch (testing)

### **Quick Deployment Commands**

#### **Deploy to Development (Testing)**
```bash
./deploy-to-dev.sh "Your commit message"
```
- Saves your work to dev environment
- Safe for testing new features
- No risk to production

#### **Deploy to Production (Live)**
```bash
./deploy-to-production.sh "Your commit message"
```
- Deploys to live production app
- Creates automatic backup before deployment
- Requires confirmation for safety

#### **Rollback if Something Breaks**
```bash
./rollback.sh backup-20241201-143022
```
- Instantly restore to any previous state
- Creates emergency backup before rollback
- Safe recovery from production issues

---

## **Typical Workflow**

### **1. Local Development**
```bash
# Make your changes locally
# Test everything works
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
```

### **2. Deploy to Dev (Recommended)**
```bash
./deploy-to-dev.sh "Added new feature"
```
- Test in dev environment first
- Catch any issues before production

### **3. Deploy to Production (When Ready)**
```bash
./deploy-to-production.sh "Deploy new feature to production"
```
- Only when you're confident it works
- Creates backup automatically
- Confirms with you before deploying

### **4. Emergency Rollback (If Needed)**
```bash
# See recent backups
git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -10

# Rollback to specific backup
./rollback.sh backup-20241201-143022
```

## **Safety Features**

### **Automatic Backups**
- Every production deployment creates a timestamped backup tag
- Emergency rollback creates additional emergency backup
- Never lose your working state

### **Confirmation Prompts**
- Production deployments require explicit confirmation
- Shows exactly what you're deploying
- Prevents accidental deployments

### **Branch Protection**
- Scripts enforce working from `main` branch
- Prevents deployment from wrong branches
- Ensures clean deployment state

### **Easy Recovery**
- One-command rollback to any previous state
- Multiple backup options available
- Clear recovery instructions

## **Best Practices**

### **Before Production Deployment**
1. ‚úÖ Test locally first
2. ‚úÖ Deploy to dev and test there
3. ‚úÖ Verify all features work
4. ‚úÖ Check for any errors in console
5. ‚úÖ Only then deploy to production

### **Emergency Procedures**
1. **Something broke in production?**
   - Run `./rollback.sh <backup-tag>` immediately
   - This will restore to last known good state
   - Fix issues locally, then re-deploy

2. **Need to check what changed?**
   - `git log --oneline -10` - see recent commits
   - `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -10` - see backups

### **Commit Messages**
Use clear, descriptive messages:
- ‚úÖ "Fix map page layout: remove redundant title and prevent scrolling"
- ‚úÖ "Add route optimization feature with email integration"
- ‚ùå "fix stuff"
- ‚ùå "updates"

## **Quick Reference**

| Command | Purpose | Safety Level |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `./deploy-to-dev.sh "message"` | Deploy to dev/testing | ‚úÖ Safe |
| `./deploy-to-production.sh "message"` | Deploy to production | ‚ö†Ô∏è Live users |
| `./rollback.sh <backup>` | Rollback production | üÜò Emergency |

## **Need Help?**

- **Deployment stuck?** Check you're on `main` branch: `git branch`
- **Can't find backup?** List all backups: `git tag --sort=-version:refname`
- **Want to see changes?** Check recent commits: `git log --oneline -10`

This workflow eliminates the complex multi-branch merging and makes deployments fast, safe, and reliable! üéâ
